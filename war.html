					<p> Hi my name is Jessica Glasses Dragon Arrow Colaco</p>
					<p> and I have medium-long ebony black hair and a name</p>
					<p> that rhymes with Bess (that's how I got my nickname Bess). </p>
					<p>	I have long nails and warm brown eyes like limpid tears  </p>
					<p>	and a lot of people tell me I look like Isaac Colaco </p>
					<p> (AN: if u don't know who he is get da hell out of here!). </p>
					<p>	I'm not related to Liston Colaco but I wish I was because </p>
					<p> he's a major fucking hottie. I'm a dragon but my teeth </p>
					<p> and nails are straight and white. I have warm brown skin.</p>
					<p> I'm also a witch, and I go to a magic school called UBC </p>
					<p> in Canada where I'm in the second year (I'm twenty-one). </p>
					<p>	I'm a goth (in case you couldn't tell) and I wear mostly </p>
					<p> black. I love Hot Topic and I buy all my clothes from there.</p>
					<p>	For example today I was wearing a black corset with </p>
					<p>	matching lace around it and a black leather miniskirt,</p>
					<p> pink fishnets and black combat boots. </p>
					<p>	I was wearing black lipstick, white foundation, black </p>
					<p> eyeliner, and I didnâ€™t need eyeshadow </p>
					<p>	because the bags under my eyes were so big. </p>
					<p> I was walking outside UBC. It was snowing and raining </p>
					<p>	so there was no sun, which I was very happy about. </p>
					<p> A lot of preps stared at me. </p>
					<p>	I put up my middle finger at them. </p>
