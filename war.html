					<p> Hi my name is Jessica Glasses Dragon Arrow Colaco and I have medium-long ebony
						 black hair and a name that rhymes with Bess (that's how I got my nickname Bess).
						  I have long nails and warm brown eyes like limpid tears and a lot of people tell
							me I look like Isaac Colaco (AN: if u don't know who he is get da hell out of here!).
							 I'm not related to Liston Colaco but I wish I was because he's a major fucking hottie.
							  I'm a dragon but my teeth and nails are straight and white. I have warm brown skin.
								I'm also a witch, and I go to a magic school called UBC in Canada where I'm in the second year (I'm twenty-one).
								 I'm a goth (in case you couldn't tell) and I wear mostly black. I love Hot Topic
								 and I buy all my clothes from there. For example today I was wearing a black corset with
								  matching lace around it and a black leather miniskirt, pink fishnets and black combat boots.
									I was wearing black lipstick, white foundation, black eyeliner, and I didnâ€™t need eyeshadow
									 because the bags under my eyes were so big. I was walking outside UBC. It was snowing and raining
									 so there was no sun, which I was very happy about. A lot of preps stared at me.
									 I put up my middle finger at them. </p>
