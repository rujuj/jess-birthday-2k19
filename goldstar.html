					<p> The stars look upon you softly with their guiding light.</p>
					<p>They watch you shine as brilliantly as they do,</p>
					<p>in all your love and passion for the ethereal cosmos in which they reside.</p>
					<p>Keep living and learning and following your heart,</p>
					<p>and wherever you go,</p>
					<p>the stars will follow,</p>
					<p>loving you as much as the people in your life do.</p>
